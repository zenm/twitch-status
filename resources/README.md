A Twitch Streamer app
=====================

h2. Who are you? Who am I?
You're a fellow developer. You might be working along side me with the freeCodeCamp curriculum. You might also be an employer wanting to check out my.

I'm Lino. I worked in Product management for 3 years. I also work as a front end developer.

h2. How did you make this project?
I made this project using the following technologies
* html
* css
* javascript
* jQuery

The following user stories helped guide the development of this project.

* I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

* I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

* if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

* I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.

h2. From what other projects did you draw inspiration?
A fellow student created a twitch app here:
https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.

Where else will you take the development of this project?
I may include the following improvements in next iterations of this app
* mobile responsiveness
